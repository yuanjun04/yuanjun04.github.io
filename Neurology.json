      "question": "A 4-year-old Dachshund presents with acute onset of paraparesis and pain on palpation of the thoracolumbar spine. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD)",
        "Meningitis",
        "Epilepsy",
        "Brain tumor"
      ],
      "answer": "Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD)",
      "explanation": "Dachshunds are predisposed to IVDD, which commonly presents with acute paraparesis and spinal pain. Imaging (MRI or CT) is required for definitive diagnosis."

      ],
      "answer": "Idiopathic epilepsy",
      "explanation": "Idiopathic epilepsy is the most common cause of seizures in dogs, typically presenting between 1-5 years of age with no underlying structural or metabolic cause."

        "Toxoplasmosis"
      ],
      "answer": "Vestibular disease",
      "explanation": "Head tilt, nystagmus, and ataxia are classic signs of vestibular disease, which can be peripheral (e.g., otitis interna) or central (e.g., brainstem lesion)."

        "Serology",
        "Electroencephalography (EEG)"
      ],
      "answer": "CSF analysis",
      "explanation": "CSF analysis is the gold standard for diagnosing meningitis, as it can reveal inflammatory cells, elevated protein, and infectious agents."
