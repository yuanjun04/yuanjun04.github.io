      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor?",
      "options": [
        "Factor II (Prothrombin)",

        "Factor IX",
        "Factor X"
      ],
      "Answer": "Factor V",
      "explanation": "Factors II, VII, IX, and X are vitamin K-dependent factors. Factor V is not vitamin K-dependent."

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "The primary initiator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway is:",
      "options": [
        "Factor XII (Hageman factor)",
        "Tissue factor (TF)",
        "von Willebrand factor (vWF)",
        "Thrombomodulin"
      ],
      "Answer": "Tissue factor (TF)",
      "explanation": "Tissue factor (also known as Factor III) is the primary initiator of the extrinsic pathway, forming a complex with Factor VII."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which test primarily evaluates the intrinsic coagulation pathway?",
      "options": [
        "Prothrombin Time (PT)",
        "Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)",
        "Thrombin Time (TT)",
        "D-dimer"
      ],
      "Answer": "Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)",
      "explanation": "aPTT evaluates the intrinsic pathway and common pathway of coagulation, while PT evaluates the extrinsic pathway and common pathway."

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following anticoagulant drugs acts by directly inhibiting thrombin (Factor IIa)?",
      "options": [
        "Warfarin",
        "Heparin",
        "Aspirin",
        "Clopidogrel"
      ],
      "Answer": "Heparin",
      "explanation": "Heparin (particularly unfractionated heparin) acts by potentiating antithrombin III, which directly inhibits thrombin (Factor IIa) and Factor Xa. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent factors, while aspirin and clopidogrel affect platelet function."

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "In Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), which parameter would typically be INCREASED?",
      "options": [
        "Platelet count",
        "Fibrinogen level",
        "Antithrombin III",
        "D-dimer level"
      ],
      "Answer": "D-dimer level",
      "explanation": "In DIC, there is increased fibrin degradation resulting in elevated D-dimer levels. Platelets, fibrinogen, and antithrombin III are typically decreased due to consumption."

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "The final common pathway of coagulation results in the conversion of:",
      "options": [
        "Prothrombin to thrombin",
        "Fibrinogen to fibrin",
        "Plasminogen to plasmin",
        "Factor X to Factor Xa"
      ],
      "Answer": "Fibrinogen to fibrin",
      "explanation": "The final step in the coagulation cascade is the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, catalyzed by thrombin, resulting in the formation of the fibrin clot."

      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which natural anticoagulant protein C inhibitor is most commonly deficient in protein-losing nephropathy in dogs?",
      "options": [
        "Antithrombin III",
        "Protein C",
        "Protein S",
        "Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)"
      ],
      "Answer": "Antithrombin III",
      "explanation": "Antithrombin III is commonly lost in protein-losing nephropathy in dogs due to its small molecular size, contributing to the hypercoagulable state seen in these patients."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Which of the following is involved in the conversion of Factor X to Factor Xa in BOTH the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways?",
      "options": [
        "Factor VII",
        "Factor VIII",
        "Factor IX",
        "Calcium ions (Ca²⁺)"
      ],
      "Answer": "Calcium ions (Ca²⁺)",
      "explanation": "Calcium ions (Ca²⁺) are required cofactors for multiple reactions in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, including the conversion of Factor X to Xa."

      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which factor deficiency is associated with hemophilia B in dogs?",
      "options": [
        "Factor VIII",
        "Factor IX",
        "von Willebrand factor",
        "Factor XI"
      ],
      "Answer": "Factor IX",
      "explanation": "Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is caused by a deficiency in Factor IX. Hemophilia A is caused by Factor VIII deficiency, while von Willebrand disease is caused by vWF deficiency."

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST potent activator of platelets?",
      "options": [
        "Thrombin",
        "ADP",

        "Thromboxane A2"
      ],
      "Answer": "Thrombin",
      "explanation": "Thrombin is the most potent platelet activator. It activates platelets through protease-activated receptors (PARs), triggering shape change, granule release, and aggregation."
