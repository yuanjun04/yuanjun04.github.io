      "id": 1,
      "question": "A 10-year-old neutered male Dachshund presents with polyuria, polydipsia, and a pendulous abdomen. Serum biochemistry reveals elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholesterol. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Diabetes mellitus",
        "Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease)",
        "Hypothyroidism",
        "Primary hyperparathyroidism"
      ],
      "answer": "Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease)",
      "explanation": "The clinical signs (polyuria, polydipsia, pendulous abdomen) and elevated ALP and cholesterol are classic for hyperadrenocorticism. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test or ACTH stimulation test would confirm the diagnosis."

        "Thyroid carcinoma",
        "Pituitary adenoma",
        "Iatrogenic hormone administration"
      ],
      "answer": "Thyroid adenoma",
      "explanation": "Thyroid adenoma is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in cats, accounting for approximately 98% of cases."

      "id": 3,
      "question": "A 6-year-old spayed female cat presents with weight loss, polyphagia, and a palpable thyroid nodule. Serum total T4 is elevated. What is the first-line treatment for this condition?",
      "options": [
        "Methimazole",
        "Radioactive iodine (I-131)",
        "Thyroidectomy",
        "Prednisolone"
      ],
      "answer": "Methimazole",
      "explanation": "Methimazole is the first-line medical treatment for hyperthyroidism in cats. It inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and is often used to stabilize the patient before definitive treatment with radioactive iodine or surgery."

      "answer": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)",

      "question": "Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic test for hypothyroidism in dogs?",
      "options": [
        "Serum total T4",
        "Free T4 by equilibrium dialysis",
        "TSH stimulation test",
        "Thyroid ultrasound"
      ],
      "answer": "Free T4 by equilibrium dialysis",
      "explanation": "Free T4 by equilibrium dialysis is the most reliable single test for diagnosing hypothyroidism in dogs, as it is less affected by non-thyroidal illness compared to total T4."
