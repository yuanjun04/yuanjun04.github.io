      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following is required for the absorption of vitamin B12 from the intestine?",
      "options": [
        "Gastric lipase",
        "Intrinsic factor",
        "Cholecystokinin",
        "Secretin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Intrinsic factor",
      "explanation": "Intrinsic factor, produced by gastric parietal cells, binds to vitamin B12 and is essential for its absorption in the ileum via specific receptors (cubilin)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In which section of the gastrointestinal tract does the majority of vitamin B12 absorption occur?",
      "options": [
        "Stomach",
        "Duodenum",
        "Jejunum",
        "Ileum"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Ileum",
      "explanation": "The majority of vitamin B12 absorption occurs in the ileum, where the intrinsic factor-B12 complex binds to specific receptors (cubilin) on enterocytes."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a coenzyme form of vitamin B12?",
      "options": [
        "Methylcobalamin",
        "Adenosylcobalamin",
        "Hydroxocobalamin",
        "Cyanocobalamin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Cyanocobalamin",
      "explanation": "Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12 used in supplements and must be converted to active forms. The active coenzyme forms are methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Hydroxocobalamin is an intermediate form."

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which enzyme requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA?",
      "options": [
        "Methionine synthase",
        "Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase",
        "Homocysteine methyltransferase",
        "Thymidylate synthase"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase",
      "explanation": "Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase requires adenosylcobalamin (a form of B12) as a cofactor for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and certain amino acids."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "In dogs with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI), vitamin B12 deficiency often occurs due to:",
      "options": [
        "Decreased production of intrinsic factor",
        "Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)",
        "Decreased R-protein production",
        "Inability to activate vitamin B12"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)",
      "explanation": "In EPI, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) commonly occurs due to reduced antimicrobial pancreatic enzymes. The bacteria compete for and utilize dietary B12, leading to deficiency. Unlike humans, dogs produce intrinsic factor primarily in the pancreas but also in the stomach."

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which vitamin B12-dependent enzyme is involved in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine?",
      "options": [
        "Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase",
        "Methionine synthase",
        "Serine hydroxymethyltransferase",
        "Thymidylate synthase"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Methionine synthase",
      "explanation": "Methionine synthase requires methylcobalamin (a form of B12) as a cofactor for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, with methyltetrahydrofolate serving as the methyl donor."

      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which breed of cat has been reported to have a hereditary cobalamin malabsorption disorder?",
      "options": [
        "Persian",
        "Siamese",
        "Giant Schnauzer",
        "Australian Shepherd"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Giant Schnauzer",
      "explanation": "Giant Schnauzers have been reported to have a hereditary selective cobalamin malabsorption disorder (Imerslund-Gr√§sbeck syndrome), characterized by proteinuria and vitamin B12 deficiency. This has not been documented in the cat breeds listed."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the primary circulating transport protein for vitamin B12 in blood?",
      "options": [
        "Albumin",
        "Transcobalamin II",
        "Intrinsic factor",
        "Haptocorrin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Transcobalamin II",
      "explanation": "Transcobalamin II is the main transport protein that delivers vitamin B12 to tissues. Haptocorrin (transcobalamin I) is another transport protein but primarily carries B12 that is not immediately available for cellular uptake."

      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which clinical sign is LEAST likely to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in dogs?",
      "options": [
        "Megaloblastic anemia",
        "Neurological deficits",
        "Failure to thrive",
        "Polyuria and polydipsia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Polyuria and polydipsia",
      "explanation": "Polyuria and polydipsia are not typically associated with B12 deficiency. Common signs include megaloblastic anemia (due to impaired DNA synthesis), neurological deficits (from impaired myelin synthesis), and failure to thrive."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which laboratory finding is most specific for diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency?",
      "options": [
        "Elevated serum methylmalonic acid",
        "Microcytic anemia",
        "Hypoproteinemia",
        "Elevated alkaline phosphatase"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Elevated serum methylmalonic acid",
      "explanation": "Elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a specific marker for functional B12 deficiency, as B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Without this conversion, methylmalonic acid accumulates in the blood and urine."
