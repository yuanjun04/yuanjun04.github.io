      "question": "Which of the following cells are primarily responsible for recycling iron from senescent erythrocytes?",
      "options": [
        "Hepatocytes",
        "Enterocytes",
        "Macrophages",
        "Myocytes"
      ],
      "answer": "Macrophages",
      "explanation": "Macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, particularly in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, phagocytose senescent erythrocytes and recycle iron from hemoglobin. This recycling accounts for most of the daily iron needs."

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which protein is the primary iron storage molecule in cells?",
      "options": [
        "Transferrin",
        "Ferritin",
        "Hemosiderin",
        "Lactoferrin"
      ],
      "answer": "Ferritin",
      "explanation": "Ferritin is the primary intracellular iron storage protein. It can store up to 4500 iron atoms in its core and is found in most tissues, particularly liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Hemosiderin is an iron storage complex derived from partial lysosomal degradation of ferritin."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following regulates iron absorption in the small intestine via the enterocytes?",
      "options": [
        "Transferrin",
        "Haptoglobin",
        "Hepcidin",
        "Ceruloplasmin"
      ],
      "answer": "Hepcidin",
      "explanation": "Hepcidin is the primary regulator of iron absorption and distribution. It binds to ferroportin (the iron exporter) on enterocytes and macrophages, causing its internalization and degradation, thereby reducing iron absorption and release."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which form of iron is absorbed more efficiently from the gastrointestinal tract?",
      "options": [
        "Ferric iron (Fe³⁺)",
        "Ferrous iron (Fe²⁺)",
        "Both are absorbed with equal efficiency",
        "Neither is absorbed directly"
      ],
      "answer": "Ferrous iron (Fe²⁺)",
      "explanation": "Ferrous iron (Fe²⁺) is absorbed more efficiently than ferric iron (Fe³⁺). Dietary ferric iron must be reduced to ferrous iron by ferric reductases (like duodenal cytochrome b) before absorption through DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1)."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "In which part of the gastrointestinal tract does most dietary iron absorption occur?",
      "options": [
        "Stomach",
        "Duodenum",
        "Jejunum",
        "Ileum"
      ],
      "answer": "Duodenum",
      "explanation": "Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum and upper jejunum. The acidic environment of the stomach helps solubilize iron but is not the primary site of absorption."

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a cause of iron deficiency in dogs?",
      "options": [
        "Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss",
        "Hookworm infestation",
        "Chronic kidney disease",
        "Dietary deficiency in adult dogs"
      ],
      "answer": "Dietary deficiency in adult dogs",
      "explanation": "Dietary iron deficiency is rare in adult dogs fed commercial diets. Iron deficiency in dogs is typically caused by blood loss, particularly from the gastrointestinal tract due to parasites, ulcers, or neoplasia."

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is the primary protein responsible for iron transport in plasma?",
      "options": [
        "Ferritin",
        "Transferrin",
        "Hemoglobin",
        "Metallothionein"
      ],
      "answer": "Transferrin",
      "explanation": "Transferrin is the primary iron transport protein in plasma. Each transferrin molecule can bind two atoms of ferric iron (Fe³⁺). It delivers iron to cells via the transferrin receptor."

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between inflammation and serum iron levels?",
      "options": [
        "Inflammation causes increased serum iron levels due to tissue damage",
        "Inflammation has no consistent effect on serum iron levels",
        "Inflammation typically causes decreased serum iron levels due to hepcidin upregulation",
        "Inflammation causes increased serum iron levels due to hepcidin downregulation"
      ],
      "answer": "Inflammation typically causes decreased serum iron levels due to hepcidin upregulation",
      "explanation": "Inflammation induces hepcidin production via IL-6 and other cytokines. Increased hepcidin reduces iron absorption and sequestrates iron in macrophages, leading to decreased serum iron - a component of the anemia of inflammatory disease."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which parameter would be LEAST useful in differentiating iron deficiency anemia from anemia of inflammatory disease?",
      "options": [
        "Serum ferritin",
        "Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)",
        "Red cell distribution width (RDW)",
        "Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)"
      ],
      "answer": "Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)",
      "explanation": "MCV is less useful in differentiating these conditions in veterinary patients as both can present with normocytic anemia initially, though iron deficiency typically progresses to microcytic. Ferritin (decreased in iron deficiency, normal/increased in AID) and TIBC (increased in iron deficiency, normal/decreased in AID) are more useful differentiators."

        "Cytochrome c",
        "Cytochrome b5",
        "Cytochrome c oxidase"
      ],
      "answer": "Cytochrome c",
      "explanation": "Cytochrome c is a heme-containing protein that functions as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain between Complex III and Complex IV, demonstrating the essential role of iron in cellular energy production."
